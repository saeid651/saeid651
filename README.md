### Hi, I'm [Saeid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saeid-parvandeh/)ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Associate with expertise in Machine Learning, Data Scientist, and Bioinformatics at Baylor College of Medicine. I am mostly experience with operational research to apply advanced analytics rigor, machine learning and statistical methods for complex problems with heterogenous large data types in cloud. In addition, I have long history of experience in designing, building, forecasting, and maintaining machine learning models to increase efficiency, accuracy, and utility of internal data processing. I have excellent problem-solving skills to plan critical and strategical solutions for technology, business and operation.

## Current Projects (WIP)

- I am working on re-designing and improving consensus features nested cross-validation [cncv](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/10/3093/5716331) with heterogenous data types for feature selection, model selection, and risk prediction.

- I am developing a multiplex network centrality that incorporates prior-knowledge [multiplexCentrality](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/13/2329/5210869?login=true) and predict the most important nodes in a network of positions in human proteins.
